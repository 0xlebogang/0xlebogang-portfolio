> 💡 I used this [template](https://shadcn-portfoliox.vercel.app/) to make this portolio. You can have a look at the repo [here](https://github.com/techwithanirudh/shadcn-portfolio).

🚀 I created this website to have an online presence and to share my work with potential employers. The project helped me improve my front-end development skills and learn more about modern web development practices. More so, how to be a power user of [Turborepo](https://turborepo.com/), my favourite JavaScript/TypeScript build tool.

## 🧩 Challenges Faced

> 💭 I'm slowly becoming more efficient when it comes to receiving a codebase, familiarizing myself with it and being able to mess around with the code to my liking. A couple of months ago, I promise you, I would have not been able to do what I did with this portfolio template.

- 🔍 Fidgetting with the CSS modules to get my feel down to the site.
- 🚀 Deploying to prod with little errors!

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- [ ] 🗃️ Add a CMS, to create a single database to manage all content of the website & user authentication
