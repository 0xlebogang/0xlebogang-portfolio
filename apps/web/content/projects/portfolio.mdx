> BTW, I used a [template](https://shadcn-portfoliox.vercel.app/) I found on github to make this portolio. Have a look at the repo [here](https://github.com/techwithanirudh/shadcn-portfolio)

This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my coding projects, resume, and skills in a beautifully designed format. I created this website to have an online presence and to share my work with potential employers. The project helped me improve my front-end development skills and learn more about modern web development practices. More so, how to be a power user of [Turborepo](https://turborepo.com/)

## Features

- **Project Showcase**: A Display with detailed descriptions of my coding projects with links to live demos and repositories.
- **Resume Integration**: Include a downloadable version of my resume in PDF format.
- **Skills Section**: Highlight technical skills in an organized and visually appealing way.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for seamless viewing across devices.
- **Blog Section**: Articles written using **MDX**, enabling dynamic content creation.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Built using **React** with **Next.js** for server-side rendering and great SEO.
- **Styling**: Styled with **Tailwind CSS** for a clean and modern UI.
- **Content Management**: Leveraged **MDX** to write interactive blogs directly in Markdown.
- **Hosting**: Deployed on **Vercel** for fast and reliable performance. Also because it intergrates well with Turborepo & Next.js

### Deployment

- Continuous deployment using **Vercel** with automatic build triggers from GitHub.
- Optimized performance with lazy loading and image optimization using **Next.js Image**.

## How It Works

1. **Landing Page**: Users are greeted with an introduction and a summary of my skills and experience.
2. **Projects Section**: Detailed view of my projects with links to live demos and GitHub repositories.
3. **About Section**: Overview of my journey, skills, and achievements.
4. **Blog Section**: Users can read technical articles and updates.
5. **Contact Form**: A user-friendly form for inquiries, integrated with **EmailJS** or **Formspree**.

## Challenges Faced

> I'm slowly becoming more efficient when it comes receiving a codebase, familiarizing myself with it and be able to mess around with the code to my liking. A couple of months ago, I promise you, I would have not been able to do what I did with this portfolio template.

- Fidgetting with the CSS modules to get my feel down to the site.
- Deploying to prod with little errors!

## Future Enhancements

- Adding dark mode functionality for a personalized user experience.
- Implementing analytics to track visitor interactions and popular sections.
- Introducing a portfolio customization feature for personalized themes.
