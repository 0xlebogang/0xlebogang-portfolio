# Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

So I found this really cool portfolio website template. âœ¨ I won't gate keep, I promise. But this is so cool! ðŸ”¥ What I like most is the fact that it comes with a preconfigured blog & I can basically write my blogs right in my favourite code editor! ðŸ’»

### Anyways... Let's write Hello world programs in the languages I usually code in. ðŸ‘‡

#### Python

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

#### Go

```go
import 'fmt'

func main() {
    fmt.println("Hello World!")
}
```

#### TypeScript

```typescript
const msg: string = "Hello World";

console.log(msg);
```

Soon enough, I'll start talking about my favourite frameworks. For now, have a look at my [projects](http://localhost:3000/projects) page to see what I've built!
