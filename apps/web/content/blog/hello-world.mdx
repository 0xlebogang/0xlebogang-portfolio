# Hello World! 👋

So I found this really cool portfolio website template. ✨ I won't gate keep, have a look at my [portfolio project](https://lebophosh.vercel.app/projects/portfolio) if you want to get access to the repo. But this is so cool! 🔥 What I like most is the fact that it comes with a preconfigured blog! I can write my blogs right in my favourite code editor! 💻

### Anyways... Let's write Hello world programs in my used programming languages. 👇

#### Python

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

#### Go

```go
import 'fmt'

func main() {
    fmt.println("Hello World!")
}
```

#### TypeScript

```typescript
// Just to diffentiate from javascript
const msg: string = "Hello World";

console.log(msg);
```

#### C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    std::vector<string> msg = {"Hello", "World!"};

    for (const auto &word : msg)
    {
        std::cout << word << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Soon enough, I'll start talking about my favourite technologies, frameworks and everything I use. For now, have a look at my [projects](https://lebophosh.vercel.app/projects) page to see what I've built!
